The SDK simplifies the incorporation of inbox functionality into your application.  Convenience methods for refreshing the inbox, getting, reading and deleting messages can be found in the [task_InboxMessages Methods]({{ site.baseurl }}/appledoc/Classes/MarketingCloudSDK.html#task_InboxMessages%20Methods).

All active InboxMessages are downloaded to the device each time the application is brought to the foreground.

Messages can be delivered silently to the inbox with an `Inbox Only` message or be accompanied by a push notification using an `Inbox+Alert` message.

Inbox+Alert messages are similar to InboxOnly message, but additionally show a notification when they are received on the device.  See [Handling URLs]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implementation-urlhandling.html) for details on how to handle these notifications.

Please see [Analytics]({{ site.baseurl}}/analytics/analytics.html#track-inbox-message-opens) for details regarding recording InboxMessage analytics.

#### Display Implementation

If your application includes basic inbox UI requirements, consider using the built-in support of MarketingCloudSDK.

The SDK provides a UITableView datasource for you to use in a UIViewController to display the Inbox-only messages sent from Marketing Cloud. The UIViewController you create essentially creates an inbox in your app to display these messages. The SDK adds these messages to the datasource after they are downloaded. The app does not display alerts for these messages.

Additionally, the MarketingCloudSDK provides a very basic UITableView delegate to manage the selection of rows in your tableview. Otherwise, the application must implement a UITableView delegate.

This example includes a simple implementation of an inbox using the MarketingCloudSDK as datasource and delegate:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4e6c3910935f6ccab2845091837d6474.js"></script>

For additional control, presentation, and usability, implement your own datasource and delegate using the support offered by the SDK.
