### Create your apps in Marketing Cloud

Your development, test, and deployment process is best accomplished by creating **two** unique MobilePush apps

- one for development (utilizing Apple's push sandbox)
- one for production (targeting Apple's production push system).

Before starting, make sure you have provisioned your app for push notifications as outlined in our [Provision for Push]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-provision.html) document.

Follow these steps to create new MobilePush apps (Repeat steps to create both a development and production app):
1. Log in to [Marketing Cloud MobilePush](https://mc.exacttarget.com).
1. Highlight the Mobile Studio menu and choose MobilePush from the dropdown.
1. On the top, select the Administration tab and click **Create New App** in the upper right corner.
1. Enter the name and description for the app.

    > Development app name suggestion: `[App]_DEV-APNS`.<br>Production app name suggestion: `[App]_PROD-APNS`.

### Provisioned with p8 Auth Key (Recommended):
1. Click **Choose File** and upload the icon for the MobilePush app.
1. Upload the .p8 Auth Key File created [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-provision.html) by clicking **Choose File** and choose the Auth Key on your computer to upload. This key will work for both Production and Development apps. To distinguish the difference for your app use the radio buttons described below as follows:

    > Development app: Select the **Development** APNs Environment radio button.

    > Production app: Select the **Production** APNs Environment radio button.

    > Validate the correct Auth Key File is uploaded. **This should be a text file with a .p8 file extension. Not the signing certificate used to provision your application for AdHoc or App Store deployment.**

1. Enter in the 10-character **Key ID**, this is usually the name of the .p8 text file after it is created or it can be viewed in your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list).
1. Enter in the 10-character **Team ID** associated with this Key. The team ID can be found in the [Membership tab](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership/) in your Apple Developer Account.
1. Enter in the Bundle Identifier of the app you are building. 
1. Make any applicable changes to the optional settings.
1. Note and copy the `Access Token`, `App ID` and `App Endpoint`. These values will be used to configure the SDK for development testing.<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupConfigValues-222.png" /><br/>
1. Select your account name in the upper-right corner of the [MobilePush Administration site](https://mc.exacttarget.com/cloud/#app/MobilePush/MobilePush/) and note and copy the "MID" value (numbers only).<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupMidValues.png" /><br/>
1. Click **Save**.

### Provisioned with p12 Certificate (Requires yearly renewal):

Follow these steps to create new MobilePush apps:
1. Click **Choose file** and upload the icon for the MobilePush app.
1. To upload an APNS certificate, click **Change** and choose the certificate on your computer to upload. Enter the password for the certificate.

    > Development app: upload the **iOS Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox)** .p12 file created following the directions in [Provision for Push]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-provision.html).

    > Production app: upload the **Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)** .p12 file created following the directions in [Provision for Push]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-provision.html).

    > Validate correct certificate is uploaded. The certificate should be for Push Notifications (APNS), not the signing certificate used to provision your application for AdHoc or App Store deployment. Double-check to ensure that the certificate uploaded is a valid, current APNS (push) certificate, as they expire after 1 year.

1. Make any applicable changes to the optional settings.
2. Note and copy the `Access Token`, `App ID` and `App Endpoint`. These values will be used to configure the SDK for development testing.<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupConfigValues-222.png" /><br/>
3. Select your account name in the upper-right corner of the [MobilePush Administration site](https://mc.exacttarget.com/cloud/#app/MobilePush/MobilePush/) and node and copy the "MID" value (numbers only).<br/><img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/setupMidValues.png" /><br/>
1. Click **Save**.
