The MarketingCloudSDK framework supports iOS 9 under armv7, armv7s and arm64 architectures.

To support iOS 9, build your app with Xcode 9 or later, and use conditional coding via Apple's `available` attributes when you set up push notification handling and when you register for push notifications during SDK configuration.

### Register for Push Notifications

To register for push notifications on iOS 9, use the `registerUserNotificationSettings` and `registerForRemoteNotifications` methods of `UIApplication`. Implement `UNUserNotificationCenter` with conditional code, as shown in this code sample.

#### Example: Registration

### Handle Push Notifications

To handle push notifications on iOS 9, implement `-application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` with conditional code, as shown in this code sample.

#### Example: Handling
