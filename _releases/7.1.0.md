* **Image Fill for Full-Page In-App Messages** -- Currently, the full-page in-app message template crops images to a 16:9 aspect ratio. With this update, images can fill a larger portion of the screen and drive engagement with your app. Update to the March release of the MobilePush SDK to support image fill for full-page in-app messages. Image fill is available to customers with MobilePush and Journey Builder.
