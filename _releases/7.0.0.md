* **JSON Configuration Method Removal** -- The `sfmc_configure` and `sfmc_configureWithURL` SDK configuration methods, using the `MarketingCloudSDKConfiguration.json` file, have been removed. If you are upgrading to this version of the SDK, see [Configure the SDK]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/get-started-configuresdk.html) for an example of using our [ConfigBuilder](https://salesforce-marketingcloud.github.io/MarketingCloudSDK-iOS/appledoc/Classes/MarketingCloudSDK.html#//api/name/sfmc_configureWithDictionary:error:) for simple, code-based SDK configuration.

* **Required minimum deployment target of iOS 10.0** -- Existing mobile applications will continue to function, without change. Mobile applications may continue to reference older SDK versions, without change. Applications which adopt the January, 2020 MobilePush SDK release may require a project change if your application build still supports iOS 9).
