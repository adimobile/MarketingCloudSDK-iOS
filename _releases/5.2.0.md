* **Added checks to prevent exceptions** -- We added nil checks to prevent potential exceptions that could happen when users swipe to close an app.

* **Improved log string initializers** -- To help prevent Xcode Address Sanitizer warnings, we improved the SDK's use of log string initializers.

* **Device ID migration** -- The SDK attempts to migrate the deviceId from versions of JB4ASDK 4.x.x, if possible.
