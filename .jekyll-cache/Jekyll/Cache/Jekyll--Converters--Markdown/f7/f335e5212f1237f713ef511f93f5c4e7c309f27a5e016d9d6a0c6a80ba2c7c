<blockquote>
  <p>In the January, 2020 Marketing Cloud MobilePush SDK release, support for older Android and iOS versions will be removed from the SDK.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Android will require a minimum API version of 21</li>
    <li>iOS will require a minimum deployment target of 10.0</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Existing mobile applications will continue to function, without change. Mobile applications may continue to reference older SDK versions, without change. Applications which adopt the January, 2020 MobilePush SDK release may require a project change if your application build still supports an older value (Android: earlier than API 21, iOS: iOS 9).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Added iOS 9 support</strong> ‚Äì The iOS MarketingCloudSDK framework now supports iOS 9.

    <p><strong>Added synchronous configuration calls</strong> ‚Äì To prevent developers from trying to set a contact key, tag, or attribute before configuration is complete, we added synchronous configuration calls to the API as the default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Added data privacy compliance</strong> ‚Äì This version of the iOS MarketingCloudSDK supports three privacy modes that may affect your application‚Äôs use of MobilePush: 1) Right to be Forgotten, 2) Restriction of Processing, and 3) Do Not Track. These changes assist you in preparing for data compliance regulations, such as the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="version-520">Version 5.2.0</h4>

<p><em>Released July 11th, correlating with the Marketing Cloud July 2018 release.</em></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved log string initializers</strong> ‚Äì To help prevent Xcode Address Sanitizer warnings, we improved the SDK‚Äôs use of log string initializers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Device ID migration</strong> ‚Äì The SDK attempts to migrate the deviceId from versions of JB4ASDK 4.x.x, if possible.</p>
