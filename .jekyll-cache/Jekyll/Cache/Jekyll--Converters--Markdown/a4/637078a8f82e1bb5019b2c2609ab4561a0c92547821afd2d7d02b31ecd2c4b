<h4 id="when-the-sdk-sets-the-badge">When the SDK Sets the Badge</h4>
<p>The MobilePush SDK automatically sets the application badge value if inbox messaging is enabled in your SDK configuration. The badge is set by the SDK in the following cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When an <em>Inbox</em> message is sent from Marketing Cloud, a silent push is also sent. The slient push contains a badge value that reflects the systemâ€™s count of <strong>unread</strong> inbox messages.</li>
  <li>When an <em>Alert + Inbox</em> message is sent from Marketing Cloud, the <em>Alert</em> component, which is a push notification, is sent containing a badge value that reflects the systemâ€™s count of <strong>unread</strong> inbox messages plus <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>. The plus one indicates the push notification.</li>
  <li>When the application is sent to the background, the MobilePush SDK sets the badge value to the count of <strong>unread</strong> Inbox messages.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="when-ios-sets-the-badge">When iOS Sets the Badge</h4>

<p>The application badge is set by iOS directly when a push notification created in Marketing Cloud has a badge value enabled. Neither the SDK nor the application can prevent this badge value from being set via a push notification.</p>

<h3 id="application-badging-override">Application Badging Override</h3>

<p>You can allow your application to override the SDKâ€™s badge setting. After your application takes ownership of badging during SDK configuration, the MobilePush SDK no longer sets badges reflecting Inbox message unread count.</p>

<p>To enable an applicationâ€™s override of badging, pass a configuration value into the SDKâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">sfmc_configure...</code> method via the JSON configuration file, or use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sfmc_configureWithDictionary:</code> method.</p>

<h4 id="configure">Configure</h4>

<p>To enable override, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sfmc_setApplicationControlsBadging</code> method in your configuration builder.</p>

<h4 id="setting-and-clearing-the-badge">Setting and Clearing the Badge</h4>

<p>When your application controls badging, it may be desirable to set or clear the badge value when events or data change within your app.</p>

<p>This is done by setting the badge value to an integer value.</p>
