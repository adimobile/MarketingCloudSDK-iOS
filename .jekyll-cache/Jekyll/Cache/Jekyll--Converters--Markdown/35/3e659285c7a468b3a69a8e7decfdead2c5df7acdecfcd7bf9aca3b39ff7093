I"S<p>Version 5.0.0 of the MarketingCloudSDK (formerly JB4ASDK) introduces new methods for data storage encryption that are incompatible with the methods used in JB4ASDK.</p>

<p>For applications upgrading from a version of JB4ASDK to version 5.x.x, the framework provides for migrating prior customer data, including contact key, tags and attributes, from the JB4ASDK database into the new frameworkâ€™s storage, re-encrypting the data, and cleaning up of old data files.</p>

<p>Meet these conditions for successful migration of the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the same values for Application Id and Access Token between app versions.</li>
  <li>Migration requires an app store update. The user cannot delete and reinstall the app.</li>
  <li>The app must maintain the same bundle id.</li>
  <li>The app cannot delete JB4ASDK data on its own.</li>
</ul>
